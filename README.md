Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System

Overview

This project is a Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System that automates attendance tracking using face detection and recognition. It leverages OpenCV, Flask, MySQL, and TensorFlow to detect and recognize faces, store attendance records in a database, and provide a web-based interface for management.

Features

Real-time Face Detection & Recognition using OpenCV

Automated Attendance Logging

Web-based Interface using Flask

MySQL Database Integration for storing attendance records

Deep Learning-based Face Recognition (TensorFlow & Keras)

SocketIO for Real-time Communication

Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV for Face Detection & Recognition

Flask (Backend & Web Interface)

Flask-SocketIO for Real-time Communication

Flask-MySQLdb for Database Integration

MySQL as the Database

TensorFlow & Keras for Deep Learning-based Face Recognition

CSV Handling for Exporting Attendance Data

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed along with the required dependencies.

Step 1: Clone the Repository

 git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-recognition-attendance.git
 cd facial-recognition-attendance

Step 2: Install Dependencies

 pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Set Up MySQL Database

Create a MySQL database:

CREATE DATABASE attendance_system;

Update database_details.py with your MySQL credentials:

dbhost = "your_host"
dbuser = "your_username"
dbpassword = "your_password"
dbname = "attendance_system"

Run the database migration script (if available) to create necessary tables.

Step 4: Run the Application

 python app.py

Access the web interface at: http://127.0.0.1:5000

Usage

Register Users: Capture and store images of authorized users.

Recognize Faces: The system detects faces from a live camera feed and matches them with stored records.

Mark Attendance: Once a face is recognized, attendance is recorded in the database.

View Attendance Logs: Admin can view and export attendance data.
